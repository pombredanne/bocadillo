# Responses

Bocadillo passes the request and the response objects to each HTTP view.

This means that the idiomatic way of sending a response is to mutate the `res` object directly.

::: tip
To learn more about this design decision, see our [FAQ][why-pass-req-res].

[why-pass-req-res]: ../../faq/#why-pass-the-request-and-response-around-everywhere

:::

## Sending content

Bocadillo has built-in support for common types of responses:

```python
res.text = 'My awesome post'  # text/plain
res.html = '<h1>My awesome post</h1>'  # text/html
res.media = {'title': 'My awesome post'}  # application/json
```

Setting one of the above attributes automatically sets the
appropriate `Content-Type` header (shown in comments above).

::: tip
The `res.media` attribute serializes values based on the `media_type` configured on the application, which is `application/json` by default. Refer to [Media] for more information.
:::

[media]: media.md

If you need to send another content type, use `.content` and set
the `Content-Type` header yourself:

```python
res.content = 'h1 { color; gold; }'
res.headers['content-type'] = 'text/css'
```

or, alternatively, create a [custom media handler](./media.md#custom-media-types).

## Status codes

You can set the numeric status code on the response using `res.status_code`:

```python{8}
from bocadillo import App

app = App()

@app.route("/jobs")
class Jobs:
    async def post(self, req, res):
        res.status_code = 201
```

::: tip
Bocadillo does not provide an enum of HTTP status codes. If you prefer to
use one, you'd be safe enough going for `HTTPStatus`, located in the standard
library's `http` module.

```python
from http import HTTPStatus
res.status_code = HTTPStatus.CREATED.value
```

:::

## Headers

You can access and modify a response's headers using `res.headers`, which is
a standard (but case-insensitive) Python dictionary object:

```python
res.headers['cache-control'] = 'no-cache'
```

## Streaming

Similar to [request streaming](./requests.md#streaming), response content can be streamed to prevent loading the full (and potentially large) response body into memory. An example use case may be sending the results of a massive database query over the wire.

### Basic usage

A stream response can be defined by decorating a no-argument [asynchronous generator function][async generators] with `@res.stream`. The generator returned by that function will be used to compose the full response. It should only yield **strings or bytes** (i.e. [media][media] streaming is not supported).

[async generators]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0525/#asynchronous-generators

```python
from bocadillo import App

app = App()

@app.route("/range/{n}")
async def number_range(req, res, n):
    @res.stream
    async def large_response():
        for num in range(n):
            yield str(num)
```

::: warning
A stream response is not chunk-encoded by default, which means that clients will still receive the response in one piece. To send the response in chunks, see [Chunked responses](#chunked-responses).
:::

### Handling client disconnections

By default, if the client disconnects and we `yield` another chunk, then the stream is stopped and no further action is taken.

If you need to react to client disconnections (e.g. to perform extra cleanup), you can pass `raise_on_disconnect=True` to `@res.stream` and handle the `ClientDisconnect` exception:

```python
from bocadillo import App, ClientDisconnect

app = App()

@app.route("/range/{n}")
async def number_range(req, res, n):
    @res.stream(raise_on_disconnect=True)
    async def large_response():
        try
            for num in range(n):
                yield str(num)
        except ClientDisconnect:
            print("Cleaning up numbersâ€¦")
```

## Chunked responses

The HTTP/1.1 [Transfer-Encoding] header allows to send an HTTP response in chunks.

This is useful to send large responses, or when the response's total size cannot be known until processing is finished. Plus, it allows the client to process the results as soon as possible.

This is typically combined with [response streaming](#streaming).

```python
res.chunked = True
# equivalent to:
res.headers["transfer-encoding"] = "chunked"
```

## Attachments <Badge text="0.12+"/>

If you want to tell the client's browser that the response should be downloaded and saved locally into a file, set `res.attachment` and the [Content-Disposition] header will be set for you.

[content-disposition]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition

```python
@app.route("/hello.txt")
async def send_hello(req, res):
    res.text = "Hi, there!"
    res.attachment = "hello.txt"
```

::: tip NOTE
The above example will _not_ perform any I/O nor try to read the `"hello.txt"` file. All it will do is set the `Content-Disposition` header to `attachment; filename='hello.txt'`.
:::

## File responses <Badge text="0.12+"/>

::: warning REQUIREMENTS
This feature requires that you install Bocadillo with the `files` extra, e.g.

```bash
pip install bocadillo[files]
```

:::

Sometimes, the response should be populated from a file that is not a [static file][static]. For example, it may have been generated or uploaded to the server.

[static]: ./static-files.md

This can be done with `res.file()`, a performant helper that will read and send a file _asynchronously_ in small chunks.

As an example, let's create a sample CSV file containing random data:

```python
import csv
from random import random

data = [{"id": i, "value": random()} for i in range(100)]

with open("random.csv", "w") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=["id", "value"])
    writer.writeheader()
    for item in data:
        writer.writerow(item)
```

Here's how we could populate the response with `random.csv`:

```python
@app.route("/random.csv")
async def send_csv(req, res):
    res.file("random.csv")
```

::: tip
Most of the time, files sent like this are meant to be downloaded. For this reason, `res.file()` sends the file as an [attachment](#attachments) by default.

To disable this, pass `attach=False`:

```python
@app.route("/random.csv")
async def send_csv(req, res):
    # The file will be sent "inline", i.e. displayed in the browser
    # instead of triggering a download.
    res.file("random.csv", attach=False)
```
